# If an object uses dataref(s), append then divided by a semicolon aftrer the path to the object, e.g. XPROOT/path/to/myobj3;object/dataref/1;object/dataref/2
#
# PERFORMANCE definition (optional)
# PERFORMANCE, acceleration in m/s2, pitch rate in °/s, heading rate in °/s, roll rate in °/s, maximum velocity in m/s, maximum pitch in °, maximum bank in °
#
# POINT definition
# Requires the first 3 elements, the rest are optional:
# POINT, latitude (decimal), longitude (decimal), elevation reference, elevation offset in m,maximum velocity on leg to waypoint in m/s
# Elevation reference: AGL = above ground, ABS = absolute
#
# LOOP, RETURN, STOP = Route termination specifiers, wait time (seconds) at last waypoint with LOOP or RETURN
